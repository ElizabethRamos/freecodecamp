  <h2 class="text-center">Stepping on New York for the first time!</h2>
  <p>Getting to know NY is quite an experience. It is a journey where you transport like stories of the films into your reality.
The city is cosmopolitan, complete, modern.
If you want to visit museums, just choose.
If you want to enjoying a night, you're in the right place!
New York never sleeps.
I'll tell you a little about my first trip to a land of Uncle Sam.
For being my first international trip, I arrived in NY quite anxious and apprehensive to do that to find through the city. My first impression was: how many people!
I stayed in the Aibnb apartment, in an excellent location in Lower Manhattan (near the spring st station).</p>
<h3> If you have time, I recommend you to read this text about the city on this <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Iorque" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a>.</h3>
